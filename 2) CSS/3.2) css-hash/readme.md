## Parent-Driven Hover Animation (CSS :has())
## Live : https://css-hash.netlify.app/

A CSS-only interaction demonstrating parent awareness using the `:has()` selector.

### What It Does
- Hovering a child scales it up
- The parent detects the hover using `:has()` and scales down the sibling elements
- No JavaScript involved

### Key Concepts Used
- `:has()` for parent-to-child conditional styling
- CSS specificity control using `!important`
- Smooth scaling transitions 

### Learning Outcome
Showcases how modern CSS enables parent-driven interactions that were previously only possible with JavaScript.
