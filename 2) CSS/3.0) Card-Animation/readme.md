## Animated Gradient Card

An interactive card built with modern CSS using layered linear and conic gradients.

- Linear black gradient for the content area
- Multicolor conic gradient layered up to the padding for a border effect
- Gradient rotation animated via **`@keyframes`**
- Used **`@property`** to smoothly animate the conic gradient angle
- Hover-controlled animation play/pause with box-shadow and text-shadow effects

### Takeaway
Complex background animations are achieved by animating **custom properties**, not `background-image` directly.
